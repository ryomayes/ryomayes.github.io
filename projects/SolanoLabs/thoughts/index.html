title: Solano Labs Redesign - Thoughts
---
<p>This was a project I did with Berkeley Innovation, a user experience club on campus that does pro-bono consulting for companies. I worked with two other students on a project with Solano Labs, a San Francisco based continuous integration platform.</p>

<p>This project lasted the length of the semester and involved constant communication between our student group and the Solano Labs’ product manager, Leo Cheng. Going into the project, none of us even knew what continuous integration was, so it was essential to check in with Leo as much as possible in order to quickly wrap our minds around the problem.</p>

<p>Once we were up to speed, our group met with Leo at Solano Labs’ headquarters, where I suggested a “tutorial-esque” onboarding flow much like Github Pages, with rigid but simple steps that minimized the possibility of user confusion. Leo liked this idea a lot, so our group concocted a mockup of our vision and presented it in December. Solano Labs have since integrated our ideas in their onboarding process and have reported positive results.</p>
