title: ATP Average Age - Thoughts
---
<p>The average age of the top men’s tennis players is a trend that I've been wanting to explore for a while. I've noticed that over the past few years veterans have largely dominated younger players and that a teenager hasn’t been internationally relevant since Rafa Nadal in the early 2000s. I was eager to find out how the average age of tennis players in present day compares with the average age of players throughout history.</p>

<p>The resulting diagram is interesting. What caused the massive dip in the early eighties? Why has the average age steadily increased since then? Will it ever dip again? There’s so much that has changed in the sport since 1973: racket technology, court speed, fitness, strategy, and so on. I don’t know why the average age changed as it has, but I would definitely like to find out.</p>

<p>This is the first time I've built something original with D3.js. The satisfaction of taking a question I had in mind and answering it with a visualization is something I've never experienced before.</p>
