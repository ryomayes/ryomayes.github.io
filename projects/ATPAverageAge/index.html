			<h2>Older Tennis Players Are Better Than Ever</h2>
			<p>The longevity of tennis players today is pretty mind-blowing. Players are now reaching their primes in their late twenties and it seems as though more and more players have worked up a "second wind," or a resurgence in their ranking at a later age (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliciano_L%C3%B3pez">Feliciano Lopez</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Karlovi%C4%87">Ivo Karlovic</a> all come to mind). There is also a general sense that it is now much more difficult for younger players to break into the top 100. Is this feeling accurate? How has the age of the top men's tennis players changed over time?</p>
			<p>Looking at the chart, we can see the average age of the top ATP players in 1973 was quite similar to the average age of today's top players (move your mouse over the chart to interact with it). The number climbed to above 27 in 1977 and then plummeted, resembling a stock exchange index during an economic panic. Since the drop in the early 1980s, the average age of both the ATP top 100 and top 10 is the highest it's ever been.</p>

			<p>Because the components that have caused the evolution of tennis are so multiple and intertwined, it would be ill-advised to point out a single detail as the primary causal factor in age-related success. However, many agree that the changes in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/sports/tennis/latest-advances-to-tennis-racket-put-new-spin-on-the-game.html">racket technology</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/05/clay-grass-hard-court-for-tenniss-top-players-it-doesnt-matter-anymore/257556/">court surfaces</a> have catalyzed the largest shifts in playing style.</p>
