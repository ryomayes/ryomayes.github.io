<p>Hello! I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in cognitive science and minoring in computer science. Whenever people ask me what I’m interested in or what I want to do with my life, I always find myself searching for a succinct response that isn’t there. Hopefully I can narrow something down for you here.</p>

<p>In recent years, I’ve been paying more attention to organizations that focus their efforts on producing useful information on the internet and crafting it in a way that makes it easily digestible for users. Khan Academy, Wikipedia and Duolingo are all examples of these organizations. I’m captivated by the people that push this idea forward because I think that they have an incredible amount of potential for positive social change.</p>

<p>After exploring the interactive sections of the New York Times, the Washington Post, NPR, FiveThirtyEight, and other interactive online news outlets I’ve begun following those that are pioneering the developing field of interactive journalism. For the first time in my life I think I’ve found a career option that both fits my educational background and contributes to an organization that applies the aforementioned idea.</p>

<p>Currently I’m experimenting with interactive data visualization tools to model certain trends in areas that I’m interested in and I’ve been having a lot of fun. I’ll be posting links to my newest projects (data visualization or miscellaneous) on this website and an overview of my thought process behind each project.</p>

<p>Some other bits about me: I’m the <a href="https://www.rescomp.berkeley.edu/about/jobs/desktopengineering/leadde/">Lead Desktop Engineer</a> at UC Berkeley Student Affairs Information Technology. I’m on the <a href="http://californiaclubtennis.com/">Cal Club Tennis team</a> (2014 & 2015 National Champions, woo!). I went to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ryomayes/sets/72157659711281866/">Iceland last September</a> (highly recommended) with my friend Ryan. Like every hipster in the Bay Area, I like good food and craft beer (I also like homebrewing with my sister Sydney - check out her awesome <a href="http://thethoughtburger.com">blog</a>!). I follow ATP and WTA tennis, MLB baseball (go Giants!), College Basketball and Football (go Bears!), NFL football and NBA basketball.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at ryomayes [at] berkeley.edu. You can find me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ryo.mayes">Facebook</a>, and if you want to read the ridiculous things I post you can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ryomayes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Peace!</p>
